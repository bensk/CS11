<p>Welcome to a new year of Computer Science. This class is based on the Introduction to Computer Science at the University of Berkeley, and is designed to prepare you to take college-level computer science, and expand your opportunities to explore fields in science, technology, engineering, and beyond. This year, we are partnering with TEALS (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools), which will bring engineers into the classroom as instructors, to give you a rigorous and real-world experience.</p>

<h2>
<a id="attendance" class="anchor" href="#attendance" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Attendance</h2>

<p>This class meets first period, Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. In order to keep up with concepts, content, and skills, students are expected to attend every class and be on time.
All lessons and materials are available online anytime at <a href="http://bsk.education">bsk.education</a>. It is your responsibility to complete any missing work. I work hard to make sure that is possible.</p>

<h2>
<a id="extra-learning-time" class="anchor" href="#extra-learning-time" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extra Learning Time</h2>

<p>I will hold ELT in Room 300 from 2:15-4:30 Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. I expect that you attend at least one day a week, and it will count as a homework grade. You may choose your day during the first week of the semester. If you miss a day, you can make it up within the week- for example, you normally attend Wednesday but cannot make it, you may come either Thursday or Friday without penalty. Otherwise I require a note or phone call from a parent.
This class is designed to prepare you for college-level Computer Science, which requires building the habit of working outside of normal class time.</p>

<h2>
<a id="behavior" class="anchor" href="#behavior" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Behavior</h2>

<p>This is a high school class, so I will keep it short. I expect the same core values that define MS/HS 223:
1. Compassion:  Treat your peers how you would like to be treated.
2. Scholarship: Being a student is your job. All distractions (food, phones) should be kept out.
3. Relentlessness: Be prepared. Work hard. Fall down seven times, get up eight.
4. Teamwork: Be ready to be an active, critical, and creative member of our class.
5. Reflection: Make new mistakes</p>

<h2>
<a id="tests--quizzes" class="anchor" href="#tests--quizzes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tests &amp; Quizzes</h2>

<p>Tests will be given at the end of each unit to assess your knowledge of the material.
Students can expect to have frequent open-notebook quizzes. Students who are absent must bring in a note to excuse their absence in order to make up the test/quiz within a week of their return.</p>

<h2>
<a id="raffle" class="anchor" href="#raffle" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Raffle</h2>

<p>To help encourage your punctuality, TEALS has provided prizes for a weekly raffle. You can get a raffle ticket for getting to class early, and for participation.
At the end of the year, we will have a grand prize: an Xbox One.</p>

<h2>
<a id="classwork" class="anchor" href="#classwork" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Classwork</h2>

<p>The vast majority of your work will be coding assignments, using Python. Those are to be submitted through Google Classroom. Your work will be graded by one of the three instructors for this course. Late work will automatically be deducted a point: a 4 becomes a 3, and so on.</p>

<p>During lab days, you may use headphones if you are working independently, with my OK.</p>

<h2>
<a id="guidelines-for-collaboration" class="anchor" href="#guidelines-for-collaboration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Guidelines for Collaboration</h2>

<ul>
<li>Looking at websites while you work is OK. I do this all the time.</li>
<li>Brainstorming with a friend is ENCOURAGED.</li>
<li>Having your friend teach you a new trick is GREAT.</li>
<li>You MUST write all your own code.</li>
<li>You CANNOT copy a classmate’s code.
All content you create (text, images, etc.) must be school appropriate.
All content you use must be your own work, and link to any sources (for images, music, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="topics" class="anchor" href="#topics" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Topics</h2>

<p>This semester will be using Python, a powerful and popular programming language. Using Python, we will explore key topics in Computer Science including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Algorithms</li>
<li>Loops</li>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Lists</li>
<li>Dictionaries</li>
<li>Interactivity</li>
<li>Iteration</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="supplies" class="anchor" href="#supplies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Supplies</h2>

<p>You must have:</p>

<ul>
<li>A notebook no larger than a marble notebook. I recommend one smaller (and nicer looking).</li>
<li>A flash drive</li>
<li>Pen or pencil every day.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you ever need additional help, I am always here.</p>
