## Remove the Vowels

<kbd>In PyCharm, create a file called <mark>de_vowel</mark></kbd>

Create a function, `de_vowel`, which will take a string as input and return a copy of that string with all the vowels removed. Otherwise, the string should be the same.

1. Create the function contract for `de_vowel`.

```python
def de_vowel(string):
"""
A function contract explains what the function does. So, in this case, yours might look like:

This function takes a string as an input and returns a copy of the string with the vowels removed.
"""
```

2. Write `de_vowel` using a for loop
3. Provide a few examples that confirm de_vowel works as expected:
	* What if the string is all vowels ('aeiou')?
	* What if there are no vowels ('rdcls')?
	* What if there is a mix of vowels and non-vowels and spaces ('this is silly')?

### Example

Example of the file:

```python
# explanation
def de_vowel(a_string):
	# your code goes here
no_vowels = de_vowel("This sentence has no vowels")
print(no_vowels)
# examples go here
```

Example output:

`Ths sntnc hs n vwls`

### Bonus!
Use a counter (variable you define outside of a loop to keep track of a value inside a loop) to create a function `count_vowels`.

`count_vowels` takes in a string and returns an int representing the number of vowels in the string.
